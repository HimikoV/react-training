### Short Description

It was an inner company React Academy for new employer waiting for their project to be assigned.

### During the Academy I have learnt and worked on things like: 

* Designing the App from the ground using Figma.
* Implementation of the App using React with Typescript.
* At start development with json server with later upgrade to use of Firebase database.
* Testing with Jest.
* Authentication using Firebase Auth.
* Using React Contex as a state management wrapping the app.

### How to check the app by yourself

1. Clone the repo and enter the directory
```
git clone https://github.com/LukaszKosobucki/Autumn-Shop.git
cd Autumn-Shop 
```
2. Install all the dependencies and start the client
```
npm install
npm start
```
