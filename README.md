# It is React Academy project organized inside company

### During the Academy I have learnt and worked on things like:

* Implementation of the App using React with Typescript.
* At start development with json server with later upgrade to use of Firebase database.
* Testing with Jest.
* Authentication using Firebase Auth.
* Using React Contex as a state management wrapping the app.
